## BasicTypes.proto

 Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.

<a name="Key"></a>

### Key
 A Key can be a public key from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. And similarly for RSA and ECDSA.<BR>A Key can be a smart contract ID, which means that smart contract is to authorize operations as if it had signed with a key that it owned. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key.<BR>A key can be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements.<BR>A Key can be a list of keys. Their use is dependent on context. For example, a Hedera file is created with a list of keys, where all of them must sign a transaction to create or modify the file, but only one of them is needed to sign a transaction to delete the file. So it's a single list that sometimes acts as a 1-of-M threshold key, and sometimes acts as an M-of-M threshold key.<BR>A Key can contain a ThresholdKey or KeyList, which in turn contain a Key, so this mutual recursion would allow nesting arbitrarily deep. A ThresholdKey which contains a list of primitive keys (e.g., ed25519) has 3 levels: ThresholdKey -> KeyList -> Key. A KeyList which contains several primitive keys (e.g., ed25519) has 2 levels: KeyList -> Key. A Key with 2 levels of nested ThresholdKeys has 7 levels: Key -> ThresholdKey -> KeyList -> Key -> ThresholdKey -> KeyList -> Key.<BR>Each Key should not have more than 46 levels, which implies 15 levels of nested ThresholdKeys.

<a name="Signature"></a>

### Signature
 A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.<BR>The definition of Key uses mutual recursion, so it allows nesting that is arbitrarily deep. But the current API only accepts Key messages up to 3 levels deep, such as a list of threshold keys, each of which is a list of primitive keys. Therefore, the matching Signature will have the same limitation. This restriction may be relaxed in future versions of the API, to allow deeper nesting.<BR>This message is deprecated and succeeded by SignaturePair and SignatureMap messages.

<a name="TransactionID"></a>

### TransactionID
 The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. 

| Field | Type | Description |   |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | - |
| transactionValidStart | [Timestamp](#Timestamp) | The transaction is invalid if consensusTimestamp < transactionID.transactionStartValid | |

## ConsensusService.proto

 The Consensus Service provides the ability for Hedera Hashgraph to provide aBFT consensus as to the order and<BR>validity of messages submitted to a topic, as well as a consensus timestamp for those messages.<BR>Automatic renewal can be configured via an autoRenewAccount.<BR>Any time an autoRenewAccount is added to a topic, that createTopic/updateTopic transaction must be signed by<BR>the autoRenewAccount.<BR>The autoRenewPeriod on an account must currently be set a value in createTopic between MIN_AUTORENEW_PERIOD (6999999<BR>seconds) and MAX_AUTORENEW_PERIOD (8000001 seconds). During creation this sets the initial expirationTime of the<BR>topic (see more below).<BR>If no adminKey is on a topic, there may not be an autoRenewAccount on the topic, deleteTopic is not allowed,<BR>and the only change allowed via an updateTopic is to extend the expirationTime.<BR>If an adminKey is on a topic, every updateTopic and deleteTopic transaction must be signed by the adminKey, except<BR>for updateTopics which only extend the topic's expirationTime (no adminKey authorization required).<BR>If an updateTopic modifies the adminKey of a topic, the transaction signatures on the updateTopic must fulfill both<BR>the pre-update and post-update adminKey signature requirements.<BR>Mirrornet ConsensusService may be used to subscribe to changes on the topic, including changes to the topic<BR>definition and the consensus ordering and timestamp of submitted messages.<BR>Until autoRenew functionality is supported by HAPI, the topic will not expire, the autoRenewAccount will not be<BR>charged, and the topic will not automatically be deleted.<BR>Once autoRenew functionality is supported by HAPI:<BR>1. Once the expirationTime is encountered, if an autoRenewAccount is configured on the topic, the account will be<BR>charged automatically at the expirationTime, to extend the expirationTime of the topic up to the topic's<BR>autoRenewPeriod (or as much extension as the account's balance will supply).<BR>2. If the topic expires and is not automatically renewed, the topic will enter the EXPIRED state. All transactions<BR>on the topic will fail with TOPIC_EXPIRED, except an updateTopic() call that modifies only the expirationTime.<BR>getTopicInfo() will succeed. This state will be available for a AUTORENEW_GRACE_PERIOD grace period (7 days).<BR>3. After the grace period, if the topic's expirationTime is not extended, the topic will be automatically<BR>deleted and no transactions or queries on the topic will succeed after that point.

## TransactionResponse.proto

 When the client sends the node a transaction of any kind, the node replies with this, which simply says that the transaction passed the precheck (so the node will submit it to the network) or it failed (so it won't). If the fee offered was insufficient, this will also contain the amount of the required fee. To learn the consensus result, the client should later obtain a receipt (free), or can buy a more detailed record (not free).
